### Project Description
To use our web application, go to the server host at port 5000 after running the start.sh program.
The web frontend has 3 main use cases:
  *	Add Image-key
  *	Show Image
  *	List Keys Stored

To use our manager-app, go to the server host at port 5001 which can easily be accessed through the menu bar at the top of the frontend webpage after running the start.sh program.

The manager-app has the following functionalities:
  * Configure memory-cache capacity and replacement policies for the pool
  * Manual pool scaling
  * Automatic pool scaling policy configuration
  * Clear cache settings
  * Clear DB and storage information
  * Show memory-cache pool statistics
